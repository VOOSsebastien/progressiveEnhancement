<h2>The story</h2>

Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. They said, <q class="villager"> We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.</q> The farmer said, <q><span class="farmer" ><strong>Maybe</strong>.</span></q> The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said, <q><span class="villager">Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!</span></q> The farmer again said, <q><span class="farmer"><strong>Maybe.</strong></span></q> 

The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then said, <q><span class="villager">Oh dear, that’s too <span class="bad">bad</span>,</span></q> and the farmer responded, <q><span class="farmer"><strong>Maybe.</strong></span></q> The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said, <q><span class="villager">Isn’t that great!</span></q> Again, he said, <q><span class="farmer"><strong>Maybe.</strong></span></q>

The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is <span class="good">good</span> or <span class="bad">bad</span> — <q>because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of <span class="good">good</span> fortune.</q>

<h2>Conclusion  </h2>
<span class="good">Good</span> and <span class="bad">Bad</span> are just one perspective. Bananas are <span class="good">good</span> for monkeys, but monkeys are not <span class="good">good</span> for bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it...
